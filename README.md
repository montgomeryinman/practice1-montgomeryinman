Megan Groathouse

I am an Advertising and International Studies major.

Three main activities: For school, I have been working on a large assortment of different assignments. For work, I have been working to keep the Human Sciences Websites updated and managing social media content.

Strategies for organizing my work: I read through every syllabus I am given at the beginning of the semester, then I create a list of all my assignments in order of their due date and pin it to my desktop, and lastly, I create reminders on my phone of assignemnts I have due or events I need to attend.
